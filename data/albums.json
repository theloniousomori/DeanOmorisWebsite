        "description": "I wanted to make music that no one else was making. I was emotional. 25,000 Mile Song was an enormous event. In my strangely concocted life, filled with machines and instruments. Alone, I built a cathedral. One of love and loss and hate. My boys were leaving home. My wife needed kissing. The world was at war. I was emotional.\n\nThe history and the enormous movements of time in which we were living, paved heavily the substance of these songs. The language with which I populate them feels as if it has taken me a lifetime to earn. This work is perhaps the true reckoning of an artist's humanity. And I cannot apologise for that.\n\nSo, please take what I have felt, and wear it a little while. Suck a lover’s lips and breathe it in. Plant a forest. Feel the wonders of the Universe. Dance and throw yourselves a sexual format. Teach children not the answers, but the questions. Please, listen to what I have to say. The world has allowed me. Let it in and let it out! Raise your voice to sing!\n\n25,000 mile song - 13 pieces to help locate humanity when it cries out to us!",

But I didn’t have to dig a child's grave nor did I have to beg forgiveness.

Not out of a sense of rage or protest but out of the need for me to define the beauty in a world gone and got so ugly. But still, the world kept turning, ‘That 19’ kept coming and our divisions grew wider and our belief in our kind once again seemed to be deserting us.\n\nBut there are unimaginable amounts of goodness in this world, we are made of it. The mycelium effect of people is capable and strong, when we invest in that. We feel it when we see them cry, when they sleep and when they are born. Insert picture of a war ravaged Syria where an unknown graffiti artist had painted the face of George Floyd on a broken bit of bomb damaged wall, sticking out of the busted ground from where everything as far as the eye can see, has been bombed and flattened to death. Even then. Even after all of that war. All of that death. Even there! Even there, they felt it.\n\nLife is a work of art.",

I had taken up the fight for the rainforest and grown a suitable beard. I had been powerless to film and to books and to statues made of marble. I readied myself to deliver music without apology but equal in love and in hate. I had believed in magic while it lasted and I had seen women as soft as their kind before man partitioned them. Where once the censored brain stole the full honours of my dream, on that road, I dreamt once more uncensored dreams.\n\nSean Penn was written that hot summer, when money had its boot on the throat of the world. The summer I stared at the moon, the summer I wrote these songs and lost my heart to the performance.\n\nIrresponsible Requiem – It’s a tramps requiem. El Yasuni – It’s not the car it’s the fuel. The Act – It’s a cinematic liaison with a culpable woman. French Cigarettes – It’s not about Madonna! This Is My Apology – It is exactly what it sings. There is love – It lives in every language, every soul, every tear and every smile all over this world. Principles of Mayhem – It’s the parts of us that require beauty when the world has gone ugly. Policy By Violent Means – It’s the equation for war. Always Time To Dream – It’s the song I fall asleep to.",

        "description": "Imagine a time, when people worshiped the ground that they stood upon. Where prejudice and suffering did not undermine the integrity of our souls; where freedom was not granted to the few but generated in the many. When to fight for land, food, basic sanitation or equality, was as unnecessary as the chains that bind us to inactive minds. Imagine a time where the natural world could splash about in its carnival pallet of life, and we would all know in witnessing the eruption, the courtship, the sunset, the birth of butterflies; that it would be privilege to uphold this honour. A time where our basic acts of kindness were not assigned to memory but once more helped create the push that has lifted us up and forward to be crowned the guardian of this most remarkable place, and not be its tyrant. Imagine that. Imagine a time when the quality of our imagination could make all of mankind free!\n\nAnd on that day, our words of freedom will be silent.",

I want just one woman. I want to be forged in upheaval and not be submissive of that which is essential to our kind. I want my friend to not leave me. I want fame not to be the ultimate goal for vital young lives. I want to tell man that while he was looking for God, she stood beside you. I want to be as strong and prophetic as my fragile heart.

        "description": "‘The Immortal death of Samuel Escobar’ is a bag of old protest songs from a South American protest singer.\n\nSamuel Escobar was sentenced to 4 hard years and died in prison for singing out about the injustice of the political regime. But he once lived the hedonistic life of an artist, he wrote by day and sang by night. This was the music of destiny, filled with incendiary images of prophecy, hope and the many forms of love. They crossed oceans and skies on the lips of those who had heard the voice of that old man, songs that hide in your bones and don't come off. All from a little man who once sat on stone stairs and occupied your time.\n\nSo allow his music to be the influencer of a new generation; a generation smarter, more privileged and more capable than any that preceeded it.",

Keep enough room on the non floured end of the work-surface for a piece of paper and a pencil. Ok, so now, while following your chosen recipe, also start writing a six line poem or a Haiku. With a little practice you will feel your brain actually switching from left to right hemispheres from the practice of baking to the art of writing a poem. Some people experience headaches and nausea their first time.\n\nI try to live my life in accordance with the hand made Japanese bowl made for me in Kyoto by Keoishi. It is grey, blue and unevenly thrown, but it is absolutely essential. It has been broken and magically repaired with the Japanese art of Kintsugi (to heal what is broken and in the process make it more beautiful). I drink my coffee with it, eat my rice from it and when I shower I clean it. I round down a full life to its simplicity.",
