            "lyrics": "<p> In conversation with a Swiss Astro particle physicist he said that in our galaxy alone there are approximately 200 million stars. The universe is, in his humble estimation a collection of several hundred billion galaxies both high and wide. The idea that we are alone is little more than the furthest reach of human arrogance. </p><br><p>  Do you hear it?  </p><br><p>   We have evolved too fast; our purpose cannot keep up with our greed. Our devastation, our non-compliance to nature, our failure to be what we represent. And we cannot find our own evolution; we are defined only by history. And we will be remembered in tears.   </p><br><p>    Do you hear it?    </p><br><p>     When our children die in the war it\u2019s a tragedy, when their children die in the war it\u2019s a victory. Violence is a human characteristic. The pro-lifers are killing the abortionists.     <br>     </p><br><p>      Tell me is the earth unpopular. Chinese whispers of love.      </p><br><p>       At the end of another street the corporate supermarket puts out of business the local butcher, baker, greengrocer. Its inferior products are cheap and flown in from exploited under developed countries leaving behind a massive carbon footprint and an imbalance in the ecology of life. Its customers say it\u2019s so convenient.       </p><br><p>        There are too many people poor and in need. Can you hear it?        </p><br><p>         Mankind\u2019s greatest marketing achievement is convincing us that it\u2019s all right, we\u2019re in safe hands. Life will be sustained. We are the masters of our destiny. Money is our number one objective and the sole heir to our moment of dominance. Money succeeds us as the number one priority over life.         <br>         </p><br><p>          In another corner of the world, lawyers sue governments on behalf of clients who have tripped over a tree root lifting the pavement. In response to the many lawsuits the local government has cut down all the trees on a leafy boulevard a meter above the ground. Lawyers.          </p><br><p>           Do you hear it           </p><br><p>            As a race we are unable to accept change as a rational concept. Extinction waits for those without the ability to adapt. And for the smallest moment in time extinction happens only to other animals.            </p><br><p>             Society is becoming more and more suspicious of those of us who value silence.             </p><br><p>              I am not a great man because Beethoven wrote the ninth symphony, or because of Shakespeare, Da Vinci, Einstein. We are not them. Although we wear the same skin.              </p><br><p>               Statistics delivers us fact from fiction.               </p><br><p>                Life is constructed of miscellaneous things, I grant you my presumption.                </p><br><p>                 In an AIDS clinic the businessman said he was foolish to have unprotected sex with a Nigerian prostitute. He hoped his wife wouldn\u2019t find out the hard way.                 </p><br><p>                  We dwell in the womb of our mothers when the world can no longer be bared.                  </p><br><p>                   Love, enables you to experience loss in detail.                   </p><br><p>                    We spent the day together; it was the last day before we were to become parents. We let out all our lifeboats.
